<p> 
                • The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, 
                it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf,and the modern wolf
                 is the dog's nearest living relative.<br><br>

                 • Dogs were the first species to be domesticated
                by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago
                before the development of agriculture.<br><br>

                • Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a 
                large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability 
                to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.<br><br>

                • Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around <strong> 450 </strong> globally recognized 
                dog breeds.In the Victorian era, directed human selection developed
                 the modern dog breeds, which resulted in a vast range of phenotypes.

                <br><br> • All healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, 
                have an identical skeletal structure with the exception of the number
                 of bones in the tail, although there is <b>significant skeletal variation </b>
                 between dogs of different types.


                <br><br> • Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic 
                dog (individuals or groups) to internal and external stimuli.[58] As the oldest domesticated species, 
                dogs' minds inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a result of this physical 
                and social evolution, dogs have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans more than 
                any other species and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors.
